History:
Java was created in 1995, and is currently owned by Oracle. 

Java is close to C++ and C#, which is useful for programmers who use all 3. 

Java is case-sensitive.

Java code statements must end with a semicolon;

You may have to install Java on your device. 


Java Fundamentals:

In Java, every app begins with a class name which must match the filename. 

Java Syntax:
example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Word");
    }
}

EVERY line of Java must be inside a class (our class is called Main), and the name of the java file MUST match the class name. 

The main() Method:
main() method is required in every Java program. 
public static void main(String[] args)
where any code inside the main() method gets executed. 

System.out.println() will print whatever you put inside the parantheses to the screen.
