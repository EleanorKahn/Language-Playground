History:
Java was created in 1995, and is currently owned by Oracle. 

Java is close to C++ and C#, which is useful for programmers who use all 3. 

Java is case-sensitive.

Java code statements must end with a semicolon;

You may have to install Java on your device. 


Java Fundamentals:

In Java, every app begins with a class name which must match the filename. 

Java Syntax:
example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Word");
    }
}

EVERY line of Java must be inside a class (our class is called Main), and the name of the java file MUST match the class name. 

The main() Method:
main() method is required in every Java program. 
public static void main(String[] args)
where any code inside the main() method gets executed. 

System.out.println() will print whatever you put inside the parantheses to the screen. 


Java Output / Print 
The println() method 

The System.out.println() method will print values or text, and will also add a new line for each method call. System.out.print() will NOT add a new line, but works otherwise the same. If you include text inside (as opposed to a string variable) it must be wrapped in double quotes. You can also perform mathmatical calculations inside the the println() method.


Comments in Java:

Comments in Java seem to work exactly how they do in JS, which is helpful. It also seems like C# comments are identical. 


Variables in Java
variable types:
- String (surrounded by DOUBLE QUOTES)
- int (whole numbers)
- float (stores floating point numbers, with decimals, maybe just 2, although I doubt it?)
- char (single characters, surrounded by SINGLE QUOTES)
- boolean 

to declare a variable, you specify type and assign it a value.
ex: type variableName = value;

NB - String seems to be the only type of variable whose type name is capitalized. 

variables can be reassigned by default, and if you find that you want a read-only variable, you use the "final" keyword.
ex: final int myNum = 14;
myNum will always equal 14.

You can declare multiple variables of the same type at the same time using the following syntax:
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;

to assign same time variables to the same value, you can use the following syntax:
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
