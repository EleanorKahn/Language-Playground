Overview:
C# is an OOP language created by Microsoft. It runs on the .NET framework. The first version was released in 2002. It is similar to Java, and has roots in the C family of languages.


C# Syntax:

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}

"using System" - means we can use classes from the "System" namespace. 

What is a Namespace? According to Microsoft, the namespace keyword is used to declare a scope that contains a set of related objects. Namespaces organize and provide a level of separation of code. Programiz states that they can be considered as a container which consists of other namespaces. A namespace keeps one set of names separate from another. W3 says that a namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces. 

C# ignores whitespace, but multiple lines are good for readability. 

Curly braces mark the beginning and end of a block of code.

Every line of C# must be inside a class (in this case, the name of the class is Program).

Every C# program has a Main method, and the code inside it's {} will be executed.

Console is a class in the System namespace, which has a WriteLine() method used to output/print text. Without the "using" keyword (which seems to be kind of like import?) you would have to write System.Console.WriteLine();

NB 
- C# is case-sentisitive. 
- Every line must end with a semicolon.
- The name of the C# file doesn't have to match classname (unlike Java), but they often do.
